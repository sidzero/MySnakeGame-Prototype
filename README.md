# MySnakeGame-Prototype
It's a qucik prototype of a snake game.I wanted to see how fast I could do it.To open it,play the scene named Snake and use UNITY 5 
and above.
The apple picture is from google image and the robot dog is my masterpiece(or blunder).

To play use the arrow keys.
Same as the usual snake game.

There is still one bug which I have to fix.But I didn't want to overkill it as it was a practise project only.
